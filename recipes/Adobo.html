    <h3>Adobo</h3>
        <p>This basic pork adobo recipe shows my own way of cooking pork adobo. It depicts how I make this dish using core ingredients.</p>
        <p>Note that this method might not be the same as the traditional way, but its result has always been good.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 ½ lb. pork belly cubed</li>
            <li>1 ½ teaspoons whole peppercorn pamintang buo</li>
            <li>5 to 6 pieces dried bay leaves dahon ng laurel</li>
            <li>6 to 8 cloves garlic crushed</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons soy sauce</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons coconut vinegar</li>
            <li>1 ½ cup water or beef broth</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cooking oil</li>
            <li>Salt to taste optional</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Heat the oil in a cooking pot.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic. Cook until it starts to turn light brown.</li>
        <li>Add the peppercorns and bay leaves. Continue to cook for 20 seconds so that its flavors get infused in the oil.</li>
        <li>Put the pork belly in the cooking pot. Stir and cook until it turns light brown. <br>Note: check the garlic and make sure that it does not get burnt. Adjust heat if necessary.</li>
        <li>Pour the soy sauce and beef broth (or water). Let boil. Cover and cook in low heat for 40 minutes or until the pork gets tender.<br> Add more beef broth or water if the liquid starts to dry quickly.</li>
        <li>Pour-in the vinegar. Let the liquid re-boil. Stir and cook for 8 minutes.</li>
        <li>Taste your pork adobo and decide to add salt if needed.</li>
        <li>Transfer to a serving plate. Serve.</li>
    </ul>
