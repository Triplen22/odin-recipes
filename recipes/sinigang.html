        <h3>SInigang na Baboy</h3>
            <p>
            Chockful of crisp-tender vegetables and meaty ribs and thick with the sourness of tamarind, my steaming bowl of soup provided much-needed<br>
            comfort against the harsh weather outside. It was delicious, filling, and the perfect way to warm up!
            </p>
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Pork-while you can use meatier and leaner parts such as pork shoulder (kasim)</li>
            <li>Onion-peeled and quartered</li>
            <li>Fish sauce-brings umami flavor</li>
            <li>Gabi</li>
            <li>Radish (labanos)</li>
            <li>Sitaw (long beans)</li>
            <li>Banana or finger chili peppers (siling haba)</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Rinse pork ribs and drain well.</li>
                <li>In a pot over medium heat, combine pork and enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, skimming scum that accumulates on top.</li>
                <li>Once broth clears, add tomatoes, onion, and fish sauce. Lower heat and simmer for about 1 to 1 1/2 hours or until meat is tender, adding more water as necessary to maintain about 8 cups.</li>
                <li>Add gabi and cook for about 4 to 6 minutes or until tender.</li>
                <li>Add chili peppers and radish. Continue to simmer for about 2 to 3 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add long beans. Continue to cook for about 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>Add eggplant and okra and cook for another 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
                <li>If using packaged tamarind base, add to the pot and stir until completely dissolved.</li>
                <li>Season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
                <li>Add bok choy and continue to cook for about 1 minute. Serve hot.</li>
            </ul>
